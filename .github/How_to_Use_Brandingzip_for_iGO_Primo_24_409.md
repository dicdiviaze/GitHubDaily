## Step 1: Locate the Branding.zip File
 
The first step is to locate the branding.zip file that you have downloaded. The file may be compressed in another format, such as rar or 7z, so you may need to extract it first using a program like Bandizip[^3^]. The file should have a name like branding.zip or branding\_XXX.zip, where XXX is a code that indicates the resolution of your device's screen.
 
Once you have located the branding.zip file, you need to copy it to your device's storage. The exact location may vary depending on your device and operating system, but it should be in the same folder where iGO Primo 2.4 409 is installed. For example, if you have installed iGO Primo 2.4 409 on an Android device's internal memory, you may find it in /sdcard/iGO or /storage/emulated/0/iGO.

You can use a file manager app on your device or connect your device to a computer and use Windows Explorer or Finder.
 
Make sure that the new branding.zip file has the same name as the original one. For example, if the original file was called branding\_800\_480.zip, you need to rename the new file to branding\_800\_480.zip as well. This way, iGO Primo 2.4 409 will recognize and load the new file when you launch it.
